        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in the north of Norway, RainyDays emerged from a group of
          enthusiastic outdoor adventurers who were determined to confront the
          region's unpredictable weather with gear that could stand the test of
          any climate. Established in 2011, RainyDays began with a single
          mission: to craft the finest waterproof and durable sport jackets that
          cater to the needs of the avid explorer, regardless of the season or
          weather condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The founders, a trio of lifelong friends and avid hikers, noticed a
          gap in the market for high-quality, versatile outdoor attire that
          could seamlessly transition from a casual hike to a rigorous skiing
          trip. They pooled their savings, invested in premium materials, and
          collaborated with experts in textile technology to develop their first
          line of jackets. The result was a range of products that not only
          provided exceptional protection from the elements but also maintained
          comfort and style—qualities that quickly made RainyDays a beloved
          brand among outdoor enthusiasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the company grew, so did its range of offerings. Today, RainyDays
          is a beacon for outdoor apparel, providing a robust catalogue of
          jackets that are celebrated for their craftsmanship, innovation, and
          ability to empower adventurers to explore the great outdoors in
          comfort and style.
